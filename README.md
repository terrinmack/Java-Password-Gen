# Installation
* Using class resources and google, obtained a framework of a randomized generator system.
* Created a new github repository using given starter code via UW coding bootcamp. 
* Created array variables to be used throughout the java code.
* Used simple java code to create window prompts to allow for user selection.
* Created "if" functions to follow each prompt to create a "new password".
* Used a math code to generate a randomized password given the user selected criteria via the previous window prompts.
* Ensured the webpage provides error prompts in case invalid statements are chosen.
